# Spotifind #

## Sub-Heading ##
  > For those seeking their next favorite artist,

## Summary ##
  > Once a day, with a click of a button, a user will be given a random small time music artist with a given song. You will be able to like the artist and see them on a monthly leaderboard, and see the random artists picked by previous days.

## Problem ##
  > It's hard to find new artist you like, most find them through recommendations. Curated playlists created by platforms help, but you are spoiled with choice and fomo. Streaming platforms create value for artists through exposure and distribution of music, but smaller artists still tend to get looked over.

## Solution ##
  > With spotifind, you get an artist a day, they may be bad or good, either way you don't have to think about it, just listen. All the artists will be artists with smaller fan bases that could benefit from the hands of randomness.
